## Hopper?

Named after [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper).

## ... Hazel?

Hopper sounds rabbit-like, so Hazel is named after the protagonist of my
favorite rabbit book -- Watership Down.

## But what is it?

Hazel is a language experimentation vehicle. We're trying some ideas that may
or may not work. We're trying to figure out how to best model financial
contracts, using typed functional programming and intuitionistic linear logic.
